You are not permitted to make copies of any part of the accompanying
computer code for distribution to any other person or group. However,
anyone can get a free, complete copy of the code from the NTSG
website...
www.forestry.umt.edu/ntsg  (go to "Models to Download")

The reason for this copying restriction is that we want to keep track
of who has which versions of the code, so that when updates or important
notices are released, we can reach as much of our user community as possible.

Your cooperation with this policy is greatly appreciated.
